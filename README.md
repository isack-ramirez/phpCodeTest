Dev Test
Using PHP 7.4+, connect to the referenced API endpoint using the provided credentials. Iterate through the records returned to create two separate lists. Any unit with an area value of 1, should be in one list and any area value greater than 1 in a separate list.

The lists should display the unit number, the area (SqFt), and updated_at date (formatted to be human-readable) for each unit. Please reasonably style the page to display the lists of units in a responsive, and user-friendly fashion.

Code should be committed to a public repository and the repo URL returned to our team at development@engrain.com for review by Friday, 7/1 at 6:00 PM MST.
